# mit-ai - Lab 1
Excellent warm up lab. I found myself immediately trying to program the answers, only to find I didn't fully understand the example in the first place! Taking my time and carefully combing over each detail greatly helped. Once I had a more thorough understanding, the resulting code was much shorter then what I had first tried to do.
