# mit-ai - Lab 1
I found this lab easy until the last question in backchain.py. I was supposed to just follow the instructions on the lab and create a tree that represented a 'backchaining goal tree' using the provided objects and rules.

I understand the concept of backchaining goal tree's, but somewhere the recursion confused me. I could not find a general purpose way of maintaining the AND and OR objects inside my tree without explicitly checking whether I should wrap the list of objects in either one. I also found getting used to the provided objects difficult, even with the provided reading. I spent my first 30 minutes just creating objects and printing them out in various ways to understand there behaviors.

Despite that, when I did understand how the provided objects and methods worked I was able to have quite a bit of fun figuring out the exercises. Mostly the problems are logic puzzles which are my favorite type of puzzle!
